### Objective 
The objective of this project is to Create a student management system that can handle student registrations,maintain student records, and calculate grades. The system should allow adding, editing, and deleting student information.

### Key Activities
- **Student Class:** Represents each student with attributes such as name, age, and gpa. It includes constructors, getters, setters, and a display function to show student details.
- **Menu Function:** Displays a menu with options for registering new students, displaying all students, updating student information, deleting a student, and exiting the program. It reads the user's choice and returns it.
- **Main Function:** Implements the core logic of the program using a vector to store Student objects:
o	Registering a Student: Prompts the user to enter student details and adds a new Student object to the vector.
o	Displaying Students: Iterates through the vector to display all registered students.
o	Updating Student Information: Allows the user to update a specific student's information by entering the index.
o	Deleting a Student: Deletes a student based on the index provided by the user.
o	Exiting the Program: Terminates the program when the user chooses.


### Tecnologies Used
- **C++ Programming**: It is an object-oriented programming language.
- **Functions Calling**: some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.
- **Switch Case**: Switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
